#Then, we need to create a Pandas data frame from the dictionary launch_dict.
# Create a data from launch_dict

#Finally we will remove the Falcon 1 launches keeping only the Falcon 9 launches. Filter the data dataframe using the BoosterVersion column to only keep the Falcon 9 launches. Save the filtered data to a new #dataframe called data_falcon9.
# Hint data['BoosterVersion']!='Falcon 1'

#Now that we have removed some values we should reset the FlgihtNumber column
#.loc[<row label>, <column lable>, Below .loc referring to all rows of FlighNumber column
# data_falcon9.shape[0]+1 will fetch shape i.e. [rows, column] in data , then will fecth list[0] which is number of rows +1
#Range will return a list numbered from 1 to 91
#List values will be assigned to FlightNumber columns
data_falcon9.loc[:,'FlightNumber'] = list(range(1, data_falcon9.shape[0]+1))

#Data Wrangling
#We can see below that some of the rows are missing values in our dataset
data_falcon9.isnull().sum() # Returns all null values in dataframe

#Before we can continue we must deal with these missing values. The LandingPad column will retain None values to represent when landing pads were not used.
#Dealing with Missing ValuesÂ¶
#Calculate below the mean for the PayloadMass using the .mean(). 
#Then use the mean and the .replace() function to replace np.nan values in the data with the mean you calculated.
# Calculate the mean value of PayloadMass column
ploadavg = data_falcon9['PayloadMass'].mean()

# Replace the np.nan values with its mean value
data_falcon9['PayloadMass'].replace(np.nan, ploadavg, inplace = True)

#Export prepared Data to csv
data_falcon9.to_csv('dataset_part_1.csv', index=False)
